I’m referring my brother, Murtaza Hussaini, for the Software Engineer and Tools Developer Co-op (Fall 2025) role at Ciena. Murtaza is pursuing his Master’s in Software Engineering at Ontario Tech University, after completing his Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering at York University. With 3 years of experience in C/C++, Python, Git, and GDB, Murtaza has worked on embedded real-time software, automation scripts, and system-level debugging for telecommunications systems.

He has hands-on exposure to Linux, Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, and Yocto, and has an interest in AI/ML tools and extending platform capabilities. Murtaza thrives in collaborative, agile teams and is eager to contribute to next-generation optical Ethernet and Layer 2/3 solutions. I’m confident he would bring both technical skill and curiosity to the software and tools development team.
